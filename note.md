# Useful
- `HAL_UART_Init()` calls `HAL_UART_MspInit()`

# Caveat
- When memory-to-memory mode is used, the circular and direct modes are not allowed. Only the DMA2 controller is able to perform memory-to-memory transfers. Ref: RM0390
- `DMA_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY` caveat: https://community.st.com/s/question/0D50X00009XkYz0SAF/timerdriven-single-word-memorytomemory-dma-transfer-can-it-be-done-in-hal
- `HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA` sets `XferCpltCallback` automatically
- Only USART2 is connected to the ST-LINK for nucleo-64 boards: Ref: UM1724; http://www.emcu.eu/how-to-manage-two-uart-usart2-and-usart1-under-interrupt/
    - USART1 can't receive data
- DMA1/2 might not connect to some peripherals: Ref: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/298794/dma-triggered-by-timer-using-stm32f4-discovery-board/299169
- When memory-to-memory mode is used, the circular and direct modes are not allowed. Only the DMA2 controller is able to perform memory-to-memory transfers. Ref: RM0390
